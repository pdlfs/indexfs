# some of the packages we want to import come with either "pkg-config"
# .pc files or with cmake config files, depending on how they were
# installed.   for example, glog installed with "apt-get install" on
# "libgoogle-glog-dev" puts in a "libglog.pc" while installing glog
# from source via github installs a cmake config file for glog.
#
# this is complicated by the fact that the pkg-config .pc file names
# the package "libglog" while the cmake config file from github defines
# a library target "glog::glog" that you load with find_package(glog).
#
# we'd like to be able to use either mechanism to find glog, and we'd
# like the resulting target name to match between the two mechanisms
# (i.e. we just want to use "glog::glog" for both cases).
#
# to address this we add a wrapper function that trys both way.
# we first use "find_package()" in hopes of picking up a cmake config.
