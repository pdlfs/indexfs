// This LRU cache implementation is primarily designed for the leveldb
// sub-component of the codebase. For a more general LRU cache implementation,
// consider using the LRUCache in "pdlfs-common/lru.h" directly.
//
// Levedb uses caches for two purposes. It caches SSTable data blocks and
// SSTable file handles (this includes the root index of each SSTable). Each
// SSTable data block typically consists of 4MB of data. An underlying
// filesystem open file descriptor is associated with each SSTable file handle.
// Caching prevents Leveldb from repeatedly reading the same data blocks and
// opening the same set of SSTable files. Both types of operation can be
// time-consuming.
//
// Known issue:
//
// Currently, leveldb code performs cache insertions by first looking up a key
// in a cache and then insertion is only performed when the key is not found in
// the cache. While each cache operation is protected by a mutex, the leveldb
// code uses no locking to ensure the atomicity of this lookup-and-insert
// operation.
//
// Thus, if two client threads perform cache insertion at about the same time,
// they can both lookup, find nothing, and both go do the costly operation
// (opening an SSTable file or reading an SSTable data block) and do the cache
// insertion. The second insertion would evict the first from the cache, leaving
// each thread having a handle on its own instance of the same data, and with
// only the second instance in the cache and both in memory (the first instance
// will be deleted from memory when the corresponding client thread unrefs its
// handle).
//
// We could change the cache insertion behavior to not replacing any existing
// entries, and return the current entry to the caller. But this complicates
// client code (since the caller will have to check special cases in which a
// cache handle is returned that is not on the caller's data). Moreover, this
// "no-replacing" semantic does not save clients from performing the "expensive"
// operation (reading an SSTable data block or opening an SSTable file).
//
// To ensure that "expensive" operations are only performed once by one client
// thread (this is not always necessary though), the client code will have to
// use locks outside of the cache. Thus only the first client thread does the
// expensive operation, and the other concurrent threads wait for the first to
// complete and reap its result.
//
// Unless keeping memory consumption low is critical, having multiple client
// threads perform the expensive operation and "compete" may lead to better
// performance.
