// two-level iterator yields the concatenation of all key/value pairs
// in the sequence of blocks.  Takes ownership of "index_iter" and
// will delete it when no longer needed.

// Uses a supplied function to convert an index_iter value into
// an iterator over the contents of the corresponding block.
